# Robot-SHD
Implementation of Robot Arm Task for model training for Recurrent Spiking Neural Network with the practice of reservoir constraints, plotting gradients & weights changes.

Guide to Run the model on HPC:
From the HPC terminal, type in 
1. module load anaconda3
2. conda create --name pytorch
3. conda activate pytorch
4. conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
5. conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
6. python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pytorch
Then stop and start another jupyter session
Select the pytorch kernel to open a new notebook or open another notebook with the pytorch kernel.

For implemention of Spiking Heidelberg Digits Task, the code is largely inspired by "Bojian Yin, Federico Corradi, Sander M. Boht√©. Accurate and efficient time-domain classification with adaptive spiking recurrent neural networks". Our model didn't do really well for the spiking heidelberg digit task, still work in progress.
